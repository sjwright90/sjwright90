- Hello, I am Samuel Wright
- Lead Data Scientist-Geochemist at Life Cycle Geo LLC
- I moved into data science from the geosciences, and now work at the intersection of the two
- Currently I am interested in predictive modeling of environmental geochemical data, visual analytics, and automated data pipelines for geoscientific data
- I dabble in embedded systems, focused on automated data collection, communications, and EdgeAI for environmental monitoring. C/C++, ESP-IDF, Arduino
- I would be happy to collaborate on any project within the scope of my aforementioned interests
